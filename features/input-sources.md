# Input Sources

Once you attach a OpenCvPipeline to an active camera in EasyOpenCV with the `setPipeline` method, your pipeline is automatically feed with images coming from the camera. 

To provide more flexibility, EOCV-Sim allows feeding your pipeline with images coming from different sources. You can feed a single static image or a moving video stored on your computer's disk, or stream frames from a webcam connected to your computer. These will be explained next.
