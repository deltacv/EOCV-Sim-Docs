# Input Sources

To provide more flexibility, EOCV-Sim allows feeding your pipeline with images coming from different sources. You can feed a single static image or a moving video stored on your computer's disk, or stream frames from a webcam connected to your computer. These will be explained next.

* **Image Source:**
  * These will feed your pipeline with a static image loaded in your computer's hard drive.
  * To save resources, your pipeline will just run once when you select an image source, but you can optionally resume the pipeline execution by clicking the "Pause" button under the pipeline selector.
* **Camera Source:**
  * These will feed your pipeline with a constantly changing video stream from a specified camera plugged in your computer.
  * Unlike the image sources, these will not pause the execution of you pipeline by default, but you can click the "Pause" button to pause it at any time.
*   **Video Source:**

    * These will feed your pipeline with a constantly changing video stream from a file in your hard drive, pause rules are the same as camera sources.
    * Recommended video format is _\*.avi_, although it depends on your operating system's support.
