# OpenCV and EasyOpenCV

## What is OpenCV?

OpenCV is defined as a library containing multiple programming functions that are aimed at real-time computer vision. 

The library has more than 2500 optimized algorithms, which includes a comprehensive set of both classic and state-of-the-art computer vision and machine learning algorithms. 

These algorithms can be used to detect and recognize faces, identify objects, classify human actions in videos, track camera movements, track moving objects, extract 3D models of objects, produce 3D point clouds from stereo cameras, stitch images together to produce a high resolution image of an entire scene, find similar images from an image database, remove red eyes from images taken using flash, follow eye movements, recognize scenery and establish markers to overlay it with augmented reality, and more.

## So... How do I integrate it to FTC?

The folks from OpenFTC developed a library to accomplish this in a very simple way, hiding the underlying complexities into a very simple API.

[EasyOpenCV ](https://github.com/OpenFTC/EasyOpenCV)is a library that integrates OpenCV into the FTC SDK in a straightforward manner, providing the complete OpenCV Java library plus multiple interfaces that simplify the accessing of the phone's cameras or external webcams, and to be able to easily feed images from the real world to your OpenCV algorithm.

[Here we have an example](https://github.com/OpenFTC/EasyOpenCV/blob/master/examples/src/main/java/org/openftc/easyopencv/examples/InternalCamera2Example.java) of the EasyOpenCV API, for using the internal camera of a phone to take images and send them into an OpenCvPipeline algorithm, and it can [easily be applied to a webcam too](https://github.com/OpenFTC/EasyOpenCV/blob/master/examples/src/main/java/org/openftc/easyopencv/examples/WebcamExample.java).
